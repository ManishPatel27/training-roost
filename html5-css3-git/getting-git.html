</code></pre>

<h2>clear your minds</h2>

<pre><code class="notes">`revision control`, `version control`, `source control`, `svn`, `cvs` -
forget about it
</code></pre>

<h2>Version Control</h2>

<h3>the technology is all over</h3>

<p>google docs</p>

<p>time machine</p>

<p>wordpress</p>

<h2>the obvious part</h2>

<p>you can access the history of what you did</p>

<h4>Revision 1</h4>

<pre><code class="text">+ We really hope you are enjoying roost!
</code></pre>

<h4>Revision 2</h4>

<pre><code class="text">  We really hope you are enjoying roost!
+ Aren&#39;t Rebecca and Ben awesome?
</code></pre>

<h4>Revision 3</h4>

<pre><code class="text">+ Roost! It&#39;s really that awesome
- We really hope you are enjoying roost!
  Aren&#39;t Rebecca and Ben awesome?
</code></pre>

<p>Here&#39;s the hangup: this isn&#39;t what git is about. </p>

<h2>huh?</h2>

<ul>
<li>it&#39;s how revisions work, but you would probably think up the same thing</li>
<li>the power is in the tooling that pulls apart and pushes back together revisions. </li>
<li>tooling that helps you make revisions amongst multiple members of a team. </li>
<li>tooling that lets you take a bunch of revisions and label them as a fixed point in a time-line, so to speak. </li>
</ul>

<h4>And the best tool for that? Any guesses?</h4>

<h1>git</h1>

<p><img src="http://placekitten.com/800/400" alt="a kitten for some awws!"></p>

<h3>running example</h3>

<p>Have to make plugin that truncates text after 500 chars and adds …</p>

<h2>first things first</h2>

<p>make a git repository</p>

<h3>a git what?</h3>

<p>think of a git &quot;repository&quot; as a project - it takes a folder, makes a folder
inside of it called <code>.git</code> and stores all the git information about it. </p>

<h3>What&#39;s cool is how git interacts with the file system.</h3>

<h3>quick look</h3>

<p>grab a copy of jQuery from a public git-based service (github.com)</p>

<pre><code class="bash">$ git checkout 1.8.3
$ head -5 package.json #print out the first 5 lines
4
  &quot;name&quot;: &quot;jquery&quot;,
  &quot;title&quot;: &quot;jQuery&quot;,
  &quot;description&quot;: &quot;JavaScript library for DOM operations&quot;,
  &quot;version&quot;: &quot;1.8.3&quot;,
</code></pre>

<p>now let&#39;s tell git we want to look at version 1.8.1</p>

<pre><code class="bash">$ git checkout 1.8.1
$ head -5 package.json #print out the first 5 lines
{
  &quot;name&quot;: &quot;jquery&quot;,
  &quot;title&quot;: &quot;jQuery&quot;,
  &quot;description&quot;: &quot;JavaScript library for DOM operations&quot;,
  &quot;version&quot;: &quot;1.8.1&quot;,
</code></pre>

<p>the file system responds to what you do in git - which is
awesome and A VERY KEY POINT. </p>

<h3>so lets make our own repo</h3>

<pre><code class="bash">$ cd ~\Projects
$ mkdir roost
$ cd roost
</code></pre>

<p>now the fun part</p>

<pre><code class="bash">$ git init
Initialized empty Git repository in /Users/danheberden/Projects/roost/.git/
</code></pre>

<pre><code class="bash">git &lt;command&gt; arguments...
</code></pre>

<p>give it a shot</p>

<pre><code class="bash">$ git status
# On branch master
#
# Initial commit
#
nothing to commit (create/copy files and use &quot;git add&quot; to track)
</code></pre>

<pre><code class="notes">that makes sense - we didn&#39;t, you know, *do* anything yet.
so we have a repo now! \o/
</code></pre>

<h2>let&#39;s do stuff</h2>

<pre><code>$ cd ~/Projects
$ mkdir ellipser
$ cd ellipser
$ grunt init:jquery

# follow prompts #

</code></pre>

<pre><code class="notes">edit project to have ellipser name and stuff
</code></pre>

<h3>What&#39;s going on?</h3>

<pre><code class="bash">$ git status
# On branch master
#
# Initial commit
#
# Untracked files:
#   (use &quot;git add &lt;file&gt;...&quot; to include in what will be committed)
#
# committedCONTRIBUTING.md
# mdLICENSE-MIT
# MITREADME.md
# ( ... removed files for brevity )
nothing added to commit but untracked files present (use &quot;git add&quot; to track)
</code></pre>

<h3>Untracked</h3>

<p><code>git</code> is smart</p>

<pre><code class="notes">It realizes that you might have files that you don&#39;t
want to add. It also sees that you changed files in the folder that you haven&#39;t
told `git` to do anything with.
So if we tried to actually `commit` our files (more on this in a minute) git
won&#39;t have anything to actually commit.
</code></pre>

<pre><code class="bash">$ git commit
# ...
# nothing added to commit but untracked files present (use &quot;git add&quot; to track)
</code></pre>

<p>we want control</p>

<p><code>notes
Having `git` track little change you make would be a nightmare to browse through,
track meaningful changes to code, and wouldn&#39;t let you describe those actions at all.
</code>`</p>

<h2>Meet <code>commit</code></h2>

<p>takes a snapshot of the changes and adds them to your current branch</p>

<pre><code class="notes">We haven&#39;t discussed branches yet, but we are on the default
&quot;main&quot; branch, called `master`.
</code></pre>

<p>com•mit v. <em>to hand over, as for safekeeping; charge; entrust</em></p>

<pre><code class="notes">This is essentially what a commit does. All of the files you have said to add to the current
branch will be handed over to it. Additionally, `git` asks for a message describing the
action. This makes reviewing past actions much more informative.
</code></pre>

<h3>So lets add some files!</h3>

<pre><code class="bash">$ git add *

# new files listed
</code></pre>

<pre><code class="bash">$ git status

# roughly the same output
</code></pre>

<pre><code class="notes">Before, they were &quot;untracked&quot; - meaning, they were in the &quot;staging&quot;
area of git.

&quot;staging&quot; = where you are in your git repository v.s. changes to the git working
tree (the folder you made a git repo).
</code></pre>

<h3>time to commit</h3>

<pre><code class="bash">$ git commit
</code></pre>

<p>add a commit message</p>

<pre><code class="bash">
# Please enter the commit message for your changes. Lines starting
# with &#39;#&#39; will be ignored, and an empty message aborts the commit.
# On branch master
#
# Initial commit
#
# Changes to be committed:
#   (use &quot;git rm --cached &lt;file&gt;...&quot; to unstage)
#
#       new file:   CONTRIBUTING.md
# ...
</code></pre>

<p>add a description of what this commit does up top</p>

<pre><code>Create plugin grunt project and add template code.

# Please enter the commit message for your changes. Lines starting
# ...
</code></pre>

<p>When you save and close the file, <code>git</code> reacts:</p>

<pre><code class="bash">[master (root-commit) 130c598] init
 13 files changed, 11613 insertions(+)
</code></pre>

<p>We just added a commit! But what is <code>130c598</code>?</p>

<h2>SHA</h2>

<p>Every commit creates a unique checksum (using SHA-1) of the changes and their location, resulting in a long<br>
40 character ID. </p>

<p>Typically, the first 7 or 8 characters are used to represent this SHA.
So <code>130c598</code> is short for <code>130c59894b35988b7176127de80dac1af174ad9d</code>. </p>

<p>This is important - every commit is a &quot;thing&quot; to git. It&#39;s a dot in your repositories timeline that has
much significance. </p>

<h2>More stuff</h2>

<p>Let&#39;s add some actual code to our plugin:</p>

<pre><code class="javscript">$.fn.ellipser = function() {
  return this.each(function() {
    var $el = $( this );
    var txt = $el.html();
    if ( txt &gt; 500 ) {
      $el.html( txt.slice(0,500) + &#39;…&#39; );
    }
  });
};
</code></pre>

<p>Super basic and generally crappy, but it&#39;s a start. </p>

<pre><code class="bash">$ git add src/ellipser.js
</code></pre>

<p>even if you make a change to the document, git needs to be told to
do something with it - thus, you have to re <code>git add</code> if you edit the
file more.</p>

<pre><code class="bash">$ git commit -m &quot;Add basic functionality to truncate text past 500 characters for each element.&quot;
</code></pre>

<p>some flags, like &#39;m&#39; for &#39;message&#39; use the following argument (in this case, a quoted string)
for its value. This way we can just pass a simple commit message inline with the commit
command.</p>

<h2>Review</h2>

<p>Lets see what we have so far.</p>

<pre><code class="bash">$ git show
</code></pre>

<p>This shows the latest activity on the branch. We can see our file changes for each commit. </p>

<h2>Just the tip of the iceberg</h2>

<p>Building an application often requires multiple things being worked on at once, while
maintaining a base/main/preferably-working version.</p>

<p>there is also a need to put those other pieces into the base/main version</p>

<pre><code class="notes">As you develop applications, the need to build out different pieces arises. Even if
it&#39;s just you working on a project, being able to work on something, set it aside, and come
back to it while not blowing up the working copy is pretty handy.

Even moreso is the need to shove those changes back in. And `git`&#39;s solution for this?
</code></pre>

<h1>Branching</h1>

<p>Looks easy </p>

<p><img src="img/git-tree1.jpg" alt="git tree"></p>

<pre><code class="note">make plugin break at closest word to 500 chars
</code></pre>

<pre><code class="bash">$ git branch nearestWord
$ git checkout nearestWord
</code></pre>

<p><img src="img/git-tree1.jpg" alt="git tree"></p>

<p>created a branch of <code>master</code> (the branch we were on) called <code>nearestWord</code>. Then, we switched
to that new branch by using <code>git checkout</code>. </p>

<p>see all the branches with:</p>

<pre><code class="bash">$ git branch
</code></pre>

<pre><code class="notes">These branches are identical right now
</code></pre>

<p>so lets work on the javascript </p>

<pre><code class="javascript">var slice;
if ( txt &gt; 500 ) {
  //remove chars after last found space
  slice = txt.slice( 0, 500 )
             .replace( /\s([^\s+])+$/, &#39;&#39; );
  $el.html( slice + &#39;…&#39; );
}
</code></pre>

<pre><code class="bash">$ git add src/ellipser.js
$ git commit -m &quot;remove letters after last space on shortened text to look better&quot;
</code></pre>

<p>Let&#39;s leave that be for now -  our working tree is clean, so we can switch over to master.</p>

<pre><code class="bash">$ git checkout master
</code></pre>

<pre><code class="notes">add another feature. Let&#39;s fix that whole &quot;500 characters&quot; thing.

As we like to do for sanity sake, make a new branch and check it out:
</code></pre>

<pre><code class="bash">$ git checkout -b variable
</code></pre>

<p><code>-b</code> stands for <code>branch</code> - this lets you create and switch to a branch in one line</p>

<p><img src="img/git-tree1.jpg" alt="git tree"></p>

<pre><code class="notes">So, as you can expect, this new branch won&#39;t have our new changes from `nearestWord`
in it.
</code></pre>

<pre><code class="javascript"> $.fn.ellipser = function( amount ) {
    amount = amount || 500;
    return this.each(function() {
      var $el = $( this );
      var txt = $el.html();
      // shorten the text to only 500 chars
      if ( txt &gt; amount ) {
        $el.html( txt.slice(0,amount) + &#39;…&#39; );
  // ...
}
</code></pre>

<pre><code>$ git add src/ellipser.js
$ git commit -m &quot;Update ellipser to accept how many characters to show&quot;
</code></pre>

<p>let&#39;s assume this new feature is done, tested, etc and we want to incorporate
it into master</p>

<pre><code>$ git checkout master
$ git merge variable
</code></pre>

<p>merge takes the <code>variable</code> branch and stuffs it into the current branch</p>

<pre><code class="notes">We&#39;ve switched back to master, which is our new working tree. When we specify to
merge variable, we are literally saying &quot;merge variable&#39;s changes into the current
branch&quot;.

Since, upon merging content into master, those lines haven&#39;t been changed by any other
commits there&#39;s no conflict. However, had we made a change to any of those lines in master and
THEN tried to merge in this branch, git wouldn&#39;t know which change we wanted; thus, we would
have to resolve those ourself.
</code></pre>

<h2>Staying in sync</h2>

<p>dealing with long-term branches</p>

<pre><code class="notes">So now we have an issue. We want to hop back to our `nearestWord` branch to work on it,
but wouldn&#39;t it be great to grab the latest updates to master?

We could just merge in master like we did with the other branch, but that would look weird
in our timeline - having some commits for the `nearestWord` feature, commits for the
variable length feature, and then more `nearestWord` commits.
</code></pre>

<p><img src="img/git-tree2.jpg" alt=" merge in master "></p>

<pre><code class="notes">merged in, which is *ok* i guess
</code></pre>

<p><img src="img/git-tree3.jpg" alt="but back to master"></p>

<pre><code class="notes">ugh, now we&#39;re going to have our commits all over the place
</code></pre>

<h3>rebase</h3>

<p><img src="img/git-tree4.jpg" alt="but back to master"></p>

<p><img src="img/git-tree5.jpg" alt="but back to master"></p>

<p>could do this manually</p>

<pre><code class="notes">and I&#39;ve actually seen people do this (ok, i&#39;ve done this). They save their completed
work somewhere else, make a new branch, and then paste in the new code and commit THAT. It&#39;s
a novel idea, but not quite ideal.

Instead of that original commit being based off of way back when we first started the plugin,
let&#39;s rebase. That will change that source commit to the current commit in master, and then
re-apply all of our commits as if we just made them.

Another advantage besides this looking way more sensible in the time-line, is rebasing will
stop on each commit to resolve a merge conflict. This means if there is some oddity between
your branch and the new code, you can sensibly address it on a commit by commit basis instead of
a big lump like in a merge.
</code></pre>

<p>easier merging, since every commit is replayed individually </p>

<h2>conflicts</h2>

<p>what do they look like?</p>

<pre><code>&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; HEAD
conflicting statement A
=======
conflicting statement B
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; 4e2b407f501b68f8588λ645acafffa0224b9b78:nearestWord
</code></pre>

<p>is there any easier way?</p>

<p>Tools like: kdiff3, vimdif, p4merge</p>

<p>basically lets you easily review the conflicts and choose
how you want to merge</p>

<h3>fast-forward merge</h3>

<p>just shove the commits from the branch in master</p>

<h3>recursive merge</h3>

<p><img src="img/git-merge-recursive1.jpg" alt="the problem"></p>

<p><img src="img/git-merge-recursive2.jpg" alt="the result"></p>

<p><img src="img/git-merge-recursive3.jpg" alt="how others do it"></p>

<p><img src="img/git-merge-recursive4.jpg" alt="the problem"></p>

<p>git is smart and if there are multiple ancestors of the commit,
it does a merge on those independently and uses that result in your
full merge. </p>

<h2>tags</h2>

<p>sometimes you are at a point you want to label</p>

<p><code>git tag v1.0.0</code> </p>

<p>makes the current place you&#39;re at in the repository (the commit)
associated with the tag labeled <code>v1.0.0</code>.</p>

<p>this is actually that simple - a tag is a label for a commit. </p>

<p>you can list tags with <code>git tag --list</code></p>

<h2>Glossary</h2>

<h3>commit</h3>

<h3>working tree</h3>

<h3>branch</h3>

<h3>refs</h3>

<p>tags</p>

<p>heads</p>

<h2>checkout</h2>

<p>you have a big repository of commits, grab one</p>

<p><code>git checkout</code> changes your working tree to a specific place in your repository</p>

<ul>
<li>SHA of a commit</li>
<li>BRANCH</li>
<li>TAG</li>
</ul>

<p>and you can even specify a file!</p>

<p><code>git checkout branchName file</code></p>

<h2>reset</h2>

<p>you <em>can</em> alter where your branch is using reset. For example, to erase the last
commit you could:</p>

<pre><code class="bash">$ git reset --hard HEAD~1
</code></pre>

<p>which says reset to the current head minus 1 commit. </p>

<p>you could also put a commit SHA there to reset too. </p>
