        <h2>Exception handling</h2>
        <p>
          When we encounter unexpected errors, we can tell the debugger to pause
          on exceptions (especially uncaught exceptions) and it will jump to the
          line of code where the exception was thrown the next time it happens.
          This allows us to inspect variables that might otherwise be inaccessible.
        </p>

      <div class="well">
        <h2>The debugger statement</h2>
        <p>
          The <code>debugger</code> statement will make code execution pause
          when the debugger reaches it; at that point, you can inspect anything
          of interest to you, and then allow the code to resume if you'd like.
        </p>

        <h2>Setting breakpoints</h2>
        <p>
          Sometimes it's not practical (or possible) to modify your JavaScript files
          to add a <code>debugger</code> statement; sometimes you're trying to debug a page
          that can't be reloaded because state will be lost. In those cases,
          you can set a breakpoint manually. Once set, breakpoints will stop code
          execution as if the <code>debugger</code> statement was used, but can
          be bypassed or disabled without reloading the page.
        </p>
        <button class="btn set-breakpoint">Click after setting a breakpoint</button>

        <h2>Debugging library errors</h2>
        <p>
          Debugging skills are especially useful when you run into errors that
          appear to be coming from a library like jQuery; usually the error isn't
          in the library, but in your code. In these cases, you should utilize
          both the function "Call Stack" and the "Pretty Print" tool to find out
          where the error originated. Also, it's much easier to debug <em>unminified</em>
          code.
